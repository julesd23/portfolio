# Portfolio

## Description
This is a portfolio website showcasing all of my recent work in software development, as well as details about myself. It is to keep track of the progress I make in my career, and to provide contact information to possible colleagues or employers.

## How to Run
In order to run this one just needs to follow the link to the running website, and at that point it functions as a normal website.

## Roadmap
In the future I plan to polish the design of the website and possibly add more animation effects. I also plan to add many more projects I am working on. These future projects will also include musical projects I have completed as well, as I intend for this site to be an all encompassing website for myself. I will at some point move this website to a domain that is independent of GitHub.
